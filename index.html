        <p>Remember when we first started talking again? It felt like fate brought us back together. 
            Our conversations were so natural, like no time had passed at all. I felt a spark, a thrill, 
            as we began to rediscover each other. My heart raced with excitement, 
            and I knew something special was growing between us again.</p>

        <p>Our first date was unforgettable. I still remember how cute you looked and how nice you were to me. It made me wanna cry so badly because 
            at that exact moment I knew exactly why I've always wanted to be with you. We laughed, shared stories, and it felt like time 
            stood still. Your smile lit up the world for me, and I couldn’t help but feel lucky to be there with you. That date, I realized you were 
            not just someone I liked, but someone I truly wanted to spend my whole life with.

        <p>I wanna start by thanking you for being the greatest boyfriend anyone could ever ask for. I'm really grateful for having you and waking up 
            every day knowing that you're mine. I love you so much! You’ve been my rock, always supporting me and cheering me on. 
            Your words of encouragement during tough times remind me of how lucky I am to have you in my life. I cherish every moment we spend together, 
            whether it's the little things or the big adventures.

        <p>You make me laugh like no one else does, with your quirkiness and your cuteness. You light up my day so easily. The way you tell your 
            silly jokes and the funny faces you make always manage to put a smile on my face. I love how we can be so goofy together, 
            and I treasure the moments when we just let loose and enjoy each other's company. Your laughter is music to my ears, and it fills my heart 
            with joy.

        <p>Our late-night conversations are my favorite. When I'd randomly wake up, and we'd start talking about random stuff, I loved every 
            single one of those moments. Whether we were discussing our dreams, the little things that made us happy, the sleepovers we were going to have 
            or even our fears, those intimate chats brought us closer. I cherish how we can share our deepest thoughts without hesitation,
            knowing that we have each other's support and understanding.

        <p>Your kindness and compassion inspire me every day. The way you always see the good in people and want to help others is really truly 
            inspiring, and it's one of the many reasons why I love you so much. I admire how you go out of your way to lend a hand to those in need, 
            even when it’s not convenient for you. Your heart is so big, and your selflessness is something I aspire to emulate. 
            You make the world a better place just by being in it.

        <p>You're in a bad mood right now in the VC as I'm finishing up this small "project" because you think you're "useless" or whatever your dumb brain is 
            trying to tell you. I'm sorry that lately life has been hard, relationship and social life-wise, but I promise you that I'll always be here for you, 
            no matter what. No matter what happens, I'll never leave you like I did before. It still haunts me to this day that I did that to you 
            and it cost me losing you. It genuinely ruined me, and I'm really sorry for that. You can always share your feelings with me; 
            I'll always be here to listen to you and to help you through whatever you're going through.
